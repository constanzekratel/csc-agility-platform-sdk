        <h3>Service Provider Asset Types </h3>
        <p class="Body">In order to support a defined service, there must be a corresponding <span class="Italic">service provider</span> defined. The<span class="AgilityDocsProductName">Agility Platform</span> incorporates the Service Provider Type asset type into its object model to support a hierarchy of defined service providers. </p>
        <p class="Body"> There are many built-in Service Provider Type subtypes, such as <span class="Italic">Agility Platform Collector</span>, <span class="Italic">Microsoft DHCP</span>, and <span class="Italic">Network Service</span>. And the model is extended with the addition of a service adapter, where the Service Provider Type subtype needed to configure a service provider is defined in the <span class="AgilityDocsProductName">Agility Platform</span> object model, such as <span class="Italic">AzureSQL Provider</span> and <span class="Italic">AWS&#160;ELB&#160;Provider</span>. </p>
        <p class="SubHead">Service providers for application services</p>
        <p class="Body">At deployment, a service binding (<span class="Italic">ServiceBinding</span>) is created to map the service requirements or configuration (<span class="Italic">Service</span>) to a specific service provider (<span class="Italic">ServiceProvider</span>). Service providers can be global in scope or optionally constrained to specific cloud environments and locations. </p>
        <p class="Body">The service binding is passed to the service adapter along with the desired service configuration (Service asset property values) on deployment to instantiate an actual service instance (such as a database account or virtual load balancer instance). This service binding can be used by the service adapter to persist the state of the service instance. </p>
        <p class="Body">Lifecycle operations are invoked on the service adapter as instances are provisioned, started, stopped, and released to allow the adapter to inject configuration into the workload and/or make changes to the external service (such as registering the instance with a load balancer) as needed.</p>
        <p class="SubHead">Service providers for network and infrastructure services</p>
        <p class="Body">In the <span class="AgilityDocsProductName">Agility Platform</span>, there is a class of services that corresponds to network and infrastructure services, such IP&#160;address management (IPAM). These services provide some aspect of infrastructure automation and are typically required in certain cloud environments. An example would be IPAM via DHCP in a vSphere environment where various service providers (such as DHCPd or Infoblox) are leveraged to manage address assignment based on organizational requirements/environment.</p>
        <p class="Body">In this type of infrastructure/network service, the service provider is always bound to a specific cloud and set of networks on which the service is actually deployed. Instead of an application workload specifying that the service is required, the binding of the service to a deployed workload is automated based on the configuration of the service provider. Workloads deployed into an environment (network) configured for network services are bound to the service provider on deployment. Lifecycle operations are then invoked on the service adapter to perform the equivalent of the current DHCP/DNS binding functionality.</p>
